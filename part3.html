<li class = "indent">Data and processes should be owned by a class</li>
<li class = "indent">Data that other classes don't need to see, shouldn't be made available to other classes</li>
<li class = "indent">This function was used in the operations the methods then return the value which are only accessible
through the methods themself</li>

<ul><h3>Abstraction: </h3></ul>
<li class = "indent">the process of creating an interface to your class. The interface should be at a high enough level so that data that
  is owned by the object is hidden.</li>
<li class = "indent">This function was used in the Calculation folder in the Calculation class </li>

<ul><h3>Inheritance:</h3> </ul>
<li class = "indent">When a class child class takes functionality from a parent class. Usually the relationship can be stated this way:
  child is a type of parent.</li>

<li class = "indent"> This function was used in the History folder in Calculation.py when it imports all the operations</li>

<ul><h3>Polymorphism:</h3> </ul>
<li class = "indent">The idea that a group of child classes can be treated as a parent class and the implementation of the methods that
  are called will change based on the type of the base class.</li>
<li class = "indent">I don't think this function was used</li>
