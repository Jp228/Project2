<h3 class = "space"> What is pylint? </h3>
<p class = "indent">Pylint is a tool used to check errors and warnings in python. Pylint tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for
  code smells. it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored. Pylint will display a number
  of messages as it analyzes the code. </p>
<h3 class = "space">Installing</h3>
<p class = "indent">A user can install pylint with a simple command â†’ pip install pylint</p>
<h3 class = "space">Running pylint</h3>
<p class = "indent">Pylint checks for errors, tries to enforce a coding standard, and tries to enforce a coding style. A user can do all
  of these with commands listed below.</p>
<ul>Getting a report</ul>
<li class = "indent">Pylint filename.py</li>
<ul>Getting Warning</ul>
<li class = "indent">Pylint -rn filename.py</li>
<ul>Getting errors</ul>
<li class = "indent">Pylint -E filename.py</li>
<ul>Running GUI</ul>
<li class = "indent">pylint-gui</li>
<p class = "indent">Pylint uses two types of extensions. To find a problem in the code, the first extension is checkers. Checkers can be
  used to find errors in the code. Secondly, there is also the concept of transform plugin, which represents a way
  through which the inference. A plugin is a module which should have a function register and takes the lint module as
  input. So a basic hello-world plugin can be implemented as: </p>

<p class = "indent">A user can run this plugin by placing it in the python path as:</p>
<img src="/img/img2.PNG" width="40%" height="40%" style=" margin : 0px 50px">
<p class = "indent">All of the default pylint checkers exist in pylint.checkers.Pylint tries hard to report as few false positives as
  possible for errors, but it may be too verbose with warnings.</p>

<p class = "indent">Instantiation - the realization of a predefined object</p>
<p class = "indent">Objects - the units of code that are data structure of a class</p>
<p class = "indent">Class - just like a blueprint for creating objects </p>
<p class = "indent">A namespace - group of related elements that each have a unique name or identifier for example a path of any file</p>
<p class = "indent">Constructor- constructor is declared when a class is created</p>
<p class = "indent">Fixture - a test class in a program is called fixture</p>
<p class = "indent">Type hint - providing hints to function to only accept the given data type</p>
<p class = "indent">Type cast - assign a value of one data type to another type</p>
<p class = "indent">Unit test - developers create tests cases to cover all possible states and configurations of the software units in order to discover bugs</p>
